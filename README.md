# BB's build of dwmblocks

This is my personal dwm build. Dwmblocks forked from https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks

## Installation

It can be installed using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/BijnensBram/dwmblocks
cd dwmblocks
sudo make clean install
```

### Minor dependencies

I use some  personal scripts (https://github.com/BijnensBram/Scripts) so for the config of some other programs see https://github.com/BijnensBram/dotfiles
